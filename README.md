# AI Training and Knowledge Repository

Welcome to the **AI Training and Knowledge** repository! This repository is designed to help both beginners and advanced learners deepen their understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts, techniques, and applications. The content is divided into two main sections:

1. **AI_Learning**: For those new to AI, covering foundational topics in AI, Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
2. **AI_Knowledge**: Advanced topics for more experienced practitioners, including fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), cutting-edge research on Graph-RAG, and LLM-based QA evaluation.
