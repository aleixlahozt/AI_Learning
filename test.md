## AI Training

### Overview of AI, ML, DL, NLP, and LLMs

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: AI is the field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. This includes learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

2. **Machine Learning (ML)**: ML is a subset of AI where algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML models improve their accuracy over time as they are exposed to more data.

3. **Deep Learning (DL)**: DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in data. DL is especially powerful in image and speech recognition, NLP, and LLMs.

4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLP is the branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It involves tasks like text classification, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.

5. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: LLMs are a class of models (like GPT-3 and GPT-4) that use deep learning to process and generate human language. They are trained on massive datasets and have revolutionized NLP by enabling applications like chatbots, summarization, and question answering.

## NLP (Natural Language Processing)

### Key Concepts:
- **Text Classification**: Assigning categories to text (e.g., spam detection).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying proper nouns in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying the sentiment of a given text.
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.

NLP techniques often involve preprocessing text with methods like **Tokenization** and **Stemming**, before converting text into numerical forms using models like **Word2Vec** or **TF-IDF**. Libraries like **spaCy** and **Hugging Face Transformers** are widely used in NLP development.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

**Transformers** are the foundation of LLMs, which led to significant advancements in NLP by allowing models to understand the context of words based on their relationships with other words. The **Transformer architecture** revolutionized tasks like machine translation and text generation.

### LLM Tokenizers:
LLMs process text by breaking it down into **tokens**. Tools like GPT-3 and ChatGPT rely heavily on tokenization to handle input efficiently. Understanding how **tokens** work is crucial for optimizing costs and performance in generative AI tasks.
