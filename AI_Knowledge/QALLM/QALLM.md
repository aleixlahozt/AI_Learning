## QA LLM

QA of LLM, or Quality Assurance of Large Language Models, refers to the process of evaluating and ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of large language models like GPT, BERT, or other transformer-based models. As an AI engineer, understanding QA for LLMs involves several key aspects:

### Key Components of QA for LLMs:

1. **Evaluation of Model Performance**:

   - **Accuracy and Precision**: Assessing how well the model understands and generates relevant and correct responses.
   - **Benchmarking**: Using standardized datasets and metrics to compare the model's performance against other models or previous versions.
2. **Bias and Fairness**:

   - **Bias Detection**: Identifying and mitigating biases in the model’s outputs that can stem from imbalanced training data.
   - **Fairness Evaluation**: Ensuring that the model's responses are fair and non-discriminatory across different groups and scenarios.
3. **Robustness Testing**:

   - **Adversarial Testing**: Checking how the model handles edge cases, adversarial inputs, or unexpected queries.
   - **Resilience to Noise**: Testing the model’s ability to handle noisy or ambiguous input data without significant degradation in performance.
4. **Safety and Ethical Considerations**:

   - **Content Safety**: Ensuring the model does not generate harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content.
   - **Compliance**: Verifying that the model adheres to regulatory and ethical guidelines for AI use.
5. **Operational Aspects**:

   - **Latency and Scalability**: Measuring how quickly the model responds and how well it scales with increased load.
   - **Resource Utilization**: Evaluating the computational efficiency of the model.
6. **User Feedback and Iterative Improvement**:

   - **Feedback Loops**: Incorporating user feedback to continuously improve model performance.
   - **A/B Testing**: Running different versions of the model in parallel to determine which performs better in real-world scenarios.

### Tools and Techniques:

- **Automated Testing Frameworks**: Tools like Hugging Face’s `transformers` library, or custom scripts to automate the testing process.
- **Manual Evaluation**: Involving human reviewers to assess the model’s output quality in complex scenarios.
- **Performance Metrics**: Metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, or custom metrics tailored to the specific use case of the LLM.

### Importance:

QA for LLMs is crucial for deploying AI systems that are reliable, trustworthy, and aligned with user expectations. By systematically assessing the quality of LLMs, you can ensure they deliver accurate, unbiased, and safe outputs, enhancing their utility in various applications such as chatbots, content generation, and more.

As you delve deeper into QA for LLMs, focus on understanding the specific metrics and tools relevant to your projects, and consider setting up a robust evaluation pipeline to regularly test and improve your models.

## LLM [Evaluation Metrics](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation)

Most important common metrics:

* **Answer Relevancy:** Determines whether an LLM output is able to address the given input in an informative and concise manner.
* **Correctness:** Determines whether an LLM output is factually correct based on some ground truth.
* **Hallucination:** Determines whether an LLM output contains fake or made-up information.
* **Contextual Relevancy:** Determines whether the retriever in a RAG-based LLM system is able to extract the most relevant information for your LLM as context.
* **Responsible Metrics:** Includes metrics such as bias and toxicity, which determines whether an LLM output contains (generally) harmful and offensive content.
* **Task-Specific Metrics:** Includes metrics such as summarization, which usually contains a custom criteria depending on the use-case.

#### Different Ways to Compute Metric Scores

#### G-Eval

G-Eval is a recently developed framework from a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16634.pdf) titled **“NLG Evaluation using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment”** that **uses LLMs to evaluate LLM outputs (aka. LLM-Evals), and is one the best ways to create task-specific metrics.**

#### **SelfCheckGPT:** For hallucinations evalaution

SelfCheckGPT is an odd one. [It is a simple sampling-based approach that is used to fact-check LLM outputs.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08896.pdf) It assumes that  hallucinated outputs are not reproducible, whereas if an LLM has knowledge of a given concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent facts.

SelfCheckGPT is an interesting approach because it makes detecting hallucination a reference-less process, which is extremely useful in a production setting.

## DeepEval: The LLM Evaluation Framework

* Link [here](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)

**DeepEval** is a simple-to-use, open-source LLM evaluation framework. It is similar to Pytest but specialized for unit testing LLM outputs. DeepEval incorporates the latest research to evaluate LLM outputs based on metrics such as G-Eval, hallucination, answer relevancy, RAGAS, etc., which uses LLMs and various other NLP models that runs **locally on your machine** for evaluation.

Whether your application is implemented via RAG or fine-tuning, LangChain or LlamaIndex, DeepEval has you covered. With it, you can easily determine the optimal hyperparameters to improve your RAG pipeline, prevent prompt drifting, or even transition from OpenAI to hosting your own Llama2 with confidence.
