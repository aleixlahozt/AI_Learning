# On training just the tokenization/embedding layer

How can we train the tokenization/embedding layer of an LLM without performing full fine-tuning of the entire model?

These approaches allow to focus on the token embeddings while keeping the rest of the model frozen. Here’s how it can be done:

---

### **1. Lightweight Fine-Tuning for Token Embeddings**
You can perform fine-tuning that focuses solely on the **embedding layer** while freezing the rest of the model:
- **Steps:**
  1. Add the new tokens to the tokenizer and initialize their embeddings randomly or based on similar tokens.
  2. Freeze all other layers of the model.
  3. Fine-tune only the embedding layer on a relevant dataset to train meaningful embeddings for the new tokens.

- **Advantages:**
  - Requires significantly fewer resources than full fine-tuning.
  - Updates embeddings without altering the rest of the model's behavior.

### **2. Embedding-Specific Fine-Tuning**
Some frameworks and techniques allow training embeddings independently:
- **Adapters for Embedding Layers:**  
   Use techniques like *adapter layers* (similar to LoRA) applied specifically to the embedding layer. For example:
   - Train a small adapter for new tokens without modifying existing embeddings.
   - Merge the learned adapter back into the embedding layer.
- **Partial Fine-Tuning via Parameter Groups:**  
   Many training libraries (like PyTorch or Hugging Face's `transformers`) allow you to specify parameter groups for optimization. You can isolate the embedding layer and train only that.

### **3. Using Contrastive Embedding Training**
Contrastive learning methods (e.g., **SimCSE**) can be applied to pre-train embeddings for new tokens:
- **How It Works:**
  - Create positive/negative examples involving sentences with new tokens.
  - Train the embedding layer using a contrastive objective to position the embeddings of new tokens meaningfully in the latent space.
- **Advantages:**
  - Does not require task-specific data.
  - Embeddings align better in the semantic space of the original model.

---

### **4. Retroactive Embedding Alignment**
If you know embeddings for similar tokens, you can use **linear transformations** or **averaging techniques** to initialize embeddings for the new tokens:
- For example:
  - Average embeddings of semantically similar tokens and use them as the new token’s embedding.
  - Fine-tune lightly to align embeddings with the rest of the vocabulary.

---

### **5. Embedding Initialization with External Models**
You can initialize embeddings for new tokens using another model (e.g., a smaller model trained on similar data or domain):
- Steps:
  1. Add the new tokens to the tokenizer.
  2. Extract embeddings for the new tokens from the external model.
  3. Inject these embeddings into the LLM's embedding layer.

- **Why It Works:**
  - Pre-trained embeddings from an external model can provide a good starting point, reducing the need for heavy fine-tuning.

---

### **6. Using LoRA/Adapters for Embeddings**
Although LoRA typically focuses on attention weights, it can also be applied to embeddings:
- Train low-rank matrices that modify only the token embedding space.
- Use LoRA adapters specific to embeddings without touching the rest of the model.

### **Which Method Should You Use?**
- **Lightweight Fine-Tuning:** If you have labeled data and computational resources for embedding-specific training.
- **Contrastive Methods:** If you want a data-efficient approach to align embeddings semantically.
- **Initialization-Based:** If you’re constrained by resources or need quick results with minimal tuning.
- **LoRA for Embeddings:** If you’re already using LoRA and want a simple add-on for new tokens.

These methods let you **train embeddings for new tokens independently** without modifying the entire model or requiring full fine-tuning!
