To index documents of different types, such as FAQs in a CSV file and multiple PDFs, you can follow an approach that combines both types into a single knowledge base. AWS Bedrock allows for the ingestion of documents in various formats stored in S3.

Here's how you can proceed step by step, with the necessary Python code:

### Step 1: Upload All Documents to S3
Upload both the CSV file and the PDF documents to your S3 bucket. You will organize them in separate folders or with distinct keys to keep them identifiable.

#### Python Code to Upload Files to S3:
```python
import boto3
import os

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

bucket_name = 'your-s3-bucket-name'

# Upload CSV file
csv_file_name = 'faqs.csv'
csv_s3_key = 'faqs/faqs.csv'
s3.upload_file(csv_file_name, bucket_name, csv_s3_key)

# Upload PDF files
pdf_directory = 'path/to/pdf/files'
pdf_s3_keys = []
for file_name in os.listdir(pdf_directory):
    if file_name.endswith('.pdf'):
        pdf_s3_key = f'pdfs/{file_name}'
        s3.upload_file(os.path.join(pdf_directory, file_name), bucket_name, pdf_s3_key)
        pdf_s3_keys.append(pdf_s3_key)

print(f"Files uploaded to S3: {[csv_s3_key] + pdf_s3_keys}")
```

### Step 2: Create a Knowledge Base in AWS Bedrock
Create the knowledge base by specifying the paths to both the CSV and PDF documents. You can use a list of S3 URIs for all the documents.

#### Python Code to Create a Knowledge Base:
```python
bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock')

knowledge_base_name = 'multi-doc-knowledge-base'
s3_uris = [f's3://{bucket_name}/{csv_s3_key}'] + [f's3://{bucket_name}/{key}' for key in pdf_s3_keys]

# Create the knowledge base with multiple data sources
response = bedrock.create_knowledge_base(
    Name=knowledge_base_name,
    DataSource=[
        {'S3Uri': uri, 'DataFormat': 'CSV' if uri.endswith('.csv') else 'PDF'}
        for uri in s3_uris
    ],
    Description='Knowledge base for FAQs and PDFs'
)

print(f"Knowledge base created: {response['KnowledgeBaseArn']}")
```

### Step 3: Index the Knowledge Base
Initiate indexing for the knowledge base to make all documents searchable.

#### Python Code to Index the Knowledge Base:
```python
knowledge_base_arn = response['KnowledgeBaseArn']

# Start indexing the knowledge base
index_response = bedrock.start_knowledge_base_indexing(
    KnowledgeBaseArn=knowledge_base_arn
)

print(f"Indexing started: {index_response['IndexingJobId']}")
```

### Step 4: Query the Knowledge Base
After indexing is complete, query the knowledge base as you would with any single-format data source.

#### Python Code to Query the Knowledge Base:
```python
# Wait for indexing completion as before
status = wait_for_indexing_completion(bedrock, index_response['IndexingJobId'])

if status == 'COMPLETED':
    query_response = bedrock.query_knowledge_base(
        KnowledgeBaseArn=knowledge_base_arn,
        QueryText='How do I reset my password?'
    )

    for result in query_response['Results']:
        print(f"Answer: {result['Answer']}")
else:
    print("Indexing failed.")
```

### Notes:
- **Data Formats**: AWS Bedrock supports different data formats, so you can specify `'DataFormat': 'CSV'` for CSV files and `'DataFormat': 'PDF'` for PDF files in the `DataSource` parameter.
- **S3 URIs**: Ensure each document's S3 URI is correctly specified in the list.
- **Handling Multiple Types**: By combining multiple file formats, AWS Bedrock treats each document as part of the same knowledge base, allowing queries across all uploaded content.

This approach allows you to create a robust knowledge base that incorporates FAQs from CSVs and detailed documentation from PDFs, making it versatile and comprehensive for query handling.
