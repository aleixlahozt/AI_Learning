Mortimer shows curiosity about the possibility of restoring life and inquires about the boy's knowledge, indicating a friendly relationship with Eugene.\n\nMortimer also narrates parts of the story, providing background information about a boy educated in Brussels and the details of what was found on an unfortunate man, including the lack of money.
